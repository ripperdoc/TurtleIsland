How to make a macro that formats the code generated by PoseidonUML.
This simple macro formats the generated code to Suns' requirements (with our
changes). To make the macro, open NEdit, go to Preferences > Default Settings >
Customize Menus > Macro menu. Create a new macro, name it "Format Java" for
example. Then copy the following lines into the text area for the macro command.

# Removes overflow whitespaces generated after some opening brackets "{"
replace_all("\\{ +$", "\\{", "backward", "regex")
# Removes overflow whitespaces generated after ending semicolons ";"
replace_all("; +$", ";", "backward", "regex")
# Removes the "// end .." comments.
replace_all("\} // .*", "\}", "backward", "regex")
# Removes the four overflow line feeds in the end of the generated files.
replace_all("\n\n\n\n", "", "backward", "regex")
# Removes all lines with <p> or </p> tags.
replace_all(" \\* (\\</*p\\>)+\n", "", "backward", "regex")
# Removes all empty comment lines before comment endings.
replace_all(" \\* \\n \\*/", " \\*/", "backward", "regex")
# Replaces all formatting with whitespaces to tabs (4 whitespace = 1 tab)
replace_all("    ", "\t", "backward", "regex")

After exiting, you can use the Format Java command from the Macro menu. Be aware
that this macro _might_ remove text that is wanted, but it shouldn't be very
possible, especially not possible to affect code, only strangely written
comments.

Remember that you'll have to undo several times (more than 4) to undo the whole macro.
