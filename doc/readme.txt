Q: Why does the game exits to windows immideately after start?
A: It could depend on several factors. If you have a graphics card with TV-out
or capability ov more than one monitor, make sure in it's settings that not both
views are activated. For nVidia cards, right-click on the desktop, Properties >
Settings > Advanced > [name of your graphics card] > nView and make sure Standard (DualView)
is chosen, not Cloned.
