Phase 1		The interactive movement of atleast one turtle on the display.
	*	The input needs to handle the mouse input almost completely, not the keyboard though.
	*	The graphics engine needs no preloaded graphics, but has to display and update the
		individual and draw it against some sort of background.
	*	The pregame and initialization of the other engines needs to function.
	*	The whole update-cycle needs to function, with much job in the World to be done.
		The gameengine needs complete attribute classes and a half-way complete GameObject tree, 
		focused on the indivudal, which needs to handle tasks.
		It also needs a functional TaskSystem, even though only the move task needs to be implemented.
		
		Classes or groups of classes affected, and what work is needed.
